As many of us are wearing masks in this uncertain time, the need of expression of our emotions in different way than normally is bigger than ever.
This is the great occasion to actually create the left-hand sign language just like in the Adem world.

Most of the code for this application I've took from my other app called "Pol_speak". As both of them have similar purposes- which is to teach user some sort of new language- I've decided to copy the same paths for the database.
